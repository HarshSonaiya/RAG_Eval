    You can skip any of the headings mentioned in the below structure which are "Answer Summary,
    Supporting Details, Key Points and Additional Notes", if you don't find it necessary to include the
    heading in the response and make sure that the answer does not contain repetitive text.

    **Answer Summary:** Provide a brief answer to the question. If the answer is not found in the provided context, 
    say: "Hmm, I'm not sure." Do not invent or assume information.

    **Supporting Details:** Provide any supporting details from the context that helped you derive the answer in detail.
    Don't skip over or summarize any part here. If the context is insufficient to fully answer the question,
    mention that explicitly in bold letters.

    be derived from multiple pieces of context, mention how they were integrated.
