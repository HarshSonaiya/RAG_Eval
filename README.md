# RAG_Eval: Evaluation of Retrievers in RAG Pipelines with Free Alternatives

***RAG_Eval*** is a project designed to test various retrievers that support response generation in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. 
It leverages the NeMoTron family of models for cost-free response evaluation, providing an alternative to paid tools like RAGAs (which require OpenAI's paid API).

---

## üìã OVERVIEW

The project aims to compare the performance of different retrievers in RAG pipelines using evaluation metrics such as **Helpfulness, Correctness, Coherence, Complexity, and Verbosity.** 
Instead of relying on paid APIs like **OpenAI's** for evaluation using **RAGAs**, RAG_Eval integrates the NeMoTron models for evaluation, offering a free and open-source alternative 
for performance analysis.

## ‚ú® Features

**1. Workspace Management:**
  - Create and manage workspaces, where each workspace contains a specific group of user uploaded PDFs for streamlined querying.
    
**2. Workspace and PDF Selection:**
  - Select a specific workspace for querying and narrowing down the scope by choosing single, multiple, or all PDFs within that workspace.
    
**3. Retriever Testing:**
  - Compare and analyze performance across Dense, Hybrid, Multi-query, and other retrievers.
    
**4. Free Evaluation Models:**
  - Uses NVIDIA's NeMoTron APIs, eliminating dependence on paid services.
    
**5. Comprehensive Metrics:**
  - Evaluate responses using key metrics:
    - **Helpfulness**
    - **Correctness**
    - **Coherence**
    - **Complexity**
    - **Verbosity.**
      
**6. Customizable Pipelines:** 
  - Easily extend or modify pipelines to test additional retrievers or evaluation metrics.
